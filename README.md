# UniVibe
UniVibe is a real-time, student-focused event discovery app that helps university students find, join, and create spontaneous campus events. From pop-up parties to study sessions, UniVibe uses maps, AR, and smart tags to connect students with what’s happening around them — before it’s gone.
